Day 3 – Treasure Island (Choose Your Own Adventure)

A text-based adventure game where the player makes a series of choices to
navigate through a story and attempt to find the treasure.

The game uses conditional logic to control the story flow, track whether the
player is still alive, and calculate a simple score based on successful choices.

Concepts practiced:
- conditional statements (if / elif / else)
- user input handling
- string methods (lower)
- basic state management with variables
- multi-line strings and ASCII art output

Run:
python main.py
