Miles to Km Converter (Tkinter) — Day 27

A simple GUI app that converts miles to kilometers. Built as Day 27 of my 100 Days of Code (Python) challenge to get hands-on exposure to Tkinter and basic GUI layout.

Features
	•	Enter a miles value and click Calculate
	•	Converts miles → kilometers using km = miles * 1.60934
	•	Displays the result directly in the UI

What I learned
	•	Creating a basic Tkinter window (Tk)
	•	Using common widgets: Entry, Label, Button
	•	Layout with grid() (rows/columns, padding)
	•	Linking a button click to a Python function with command=...
	•	Updating widget text dynamically

How to run

Requirements
