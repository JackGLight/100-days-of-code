Day 13 – Debugging and Problem Solving

Day 13 focused on debugging techniques and identifying common programming errors
through lectures and interactive coding exercises.

Topics covered:
- understanding error messages and stack traces
- common Python errors (syntax, runtime, logic)
- using print statements to debug code
- stepping through code execution mentally
- isolating bugs by testing small sections of code

This day did not include a standalone project, but reinforced core debugging
skills that are essential for building and maintaining reliable programs.
