Day 5 – Password Generator

A command-line password generator that creates a randomized password based on
user-defined criteria for letters, numbers, and symbols.

The program validates user input, randomly selects characters from each category,
shuffles the final password to ensure randomness, and outputs the completed password.

Concepts practiced:
- user input validation
- functions and reusable logic
- lists and list manipulation
- randomization and shuffling
- use of Python standard library modules

Run:
python main.py
