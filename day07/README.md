Day 7 – Hangman Game

A command-line implementation of the classic Hangman game built in Python.

The program randomly selects a word from an external text file and allows the
player to guess letters while tracking remaining lives and displaying an ASCII
hangman graphic that updates after each incorrect guess.

The game ends when the player either successfully guesses the word or runs out
of lives.

Concepts practiced:
- file I/O (reading from a text file)
- random selection
- lists and string manipulation
- functions and state management
- input validation
- loops and conditional logic
- ASCII graphics for game display

Files:
- main.py — game logic
- words.txt — list of possible secret words

Run:
python main.py
