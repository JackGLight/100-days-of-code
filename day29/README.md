# Password Manager (Tkinter) — Day 29

A simple password manager built with **Python and Tkinter** as part of **Day 29** of my *100 Days of Code* challenge.  
This project focuses on **GUI development**, **file I/O**, and **user interaction flows**.

---

## Features
- Generate strong random passwords
- Copy generated passwords to clipboard
- Save website, email/username, and password to a local file
- Confirmation dialog before saving entries
- Basic input validation to prevent empty saves

---

## What I Learned
- Building interactive GUIs with Tkinter
- Using `messagebox` for confirmations and warnings
- Generating secure passwords with Python’s standard libraries
- Writing and appending structured data to a text file
- Managing application state through user actions

---

## Notes
- Passwords are stored in **plain text** for learning purposes only  
- This project is focused on fundamentals, not production-level security

---

## Possible Improvements
- Encrypt stored passwords
- Hide password input
- Add search and retrieval functionality
- Switch storage to JSON or a database
