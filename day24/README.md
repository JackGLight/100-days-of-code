# Day 24 — Mail Merge

A simple mail merge program built with Python that generates personalized letters from a template.  
The script reads a list of names, replaces placeholders in a starting letter, and outputs customized text files for each recipient.

## What This Project Does

- Reads a list of invited names from a text file
- Reads a letter template containing a placeholder (`[name]`)
- Replaces the placeholder with each person’s name
- Generates a personalized letter for each name
- Saves all generated letters into an output folder

This automates a task that would otherwise be repetitive and error-prone.
