Day 10 – Calculator App

A command-line calculator application that performs basic arithmetic operations,
including addition, subtraction, multiplication, and division.

The program validates user input, prevents invalid operations such as division by
zero, and allows users to continue calculations using the previous result or start
a new calculation.

Concepts practiced:
- functions and return values
- input validation with loops and exceptions
- conditional logic
- basic arithmetic operations
- state management across iterations
- user-friendly terminal interaction

How it works:
- Users input two numbers and select an operation
- The calculator computes and displays the result
- Users can continue calculating with the current result or reset and start over

Run:
python main.py
