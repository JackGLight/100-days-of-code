# Password Manager (Tkinter) — Day 30


Today’s focus was on **persisting data with JSON** and **robust error handling**.

---

## New Concepts Practiced
- Reading from and writing to JSON files
- Updating structured data instead of appending raw text
- Using `try / except` to handle:
  - missing files
  - missing keys
  - invalid or empty JSON
- Graceful user feedback via message boxes

---

## Features
- Save credentials to a JSON file
- Search for existing entries by website
- Generate strong random passwords
- Copy passwords to clipboard
- User-friendly error and info dialogs

---

## Notes
- Passwords are stored in plain text (learning project only)
- Emphasis was on correctness and resilience rather than security
