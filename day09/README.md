Day 9 – Secret Auction Game

A command-line secret auction game where multiple users can place bids without
seeing each other’s entries.

The program collects bidder names and bid amounts in a loop, clears the screen
between entries to maintain secrecy, and determines the highest bidder once all
bids have been submitted.

Concepts practiced:
- dictionaries for storing key–value data
- loops and conditional logic
- user input handling
- basic aggregation logic
- functions and return values
- simple terminal output formatting

How it works:
- Users enter their name and bid amount
- The screen is cleared between bids to hide previous entries
- When bidding ends, the program identifies and displays the highest bidder

Run:
python main.py
