# Automated Birthday Email Sender

## Overview
This project is a Python application that automatically sends personalized birthday emails to contacts whose birthday matches the current date. It combines file handling, data parsing, date comparison, string templating, and email automation to demonstrate a complete, practical workflow.

## Core Concepts Covered

### File I/O and Data Cleaning
The program reads contact information from a CSV file and processes each line into structured data. This includes:
- Opening and reading files safely using context managers
- Splitting comma-separated values into fields
- Cleaning input data by removing whitespace and newline characters
- Handling header rows in CSV files

### Data Structures and Lookups
Birthday data is stored in a dictionary keyed by `(month, day)` tuples. This enables efficient lookup to determine whether today matches any stored birthdays, rather than repeatedly scanning the full dataset.

### Date and Time Handling
The `datetime` module is used to retrieve the current month and day. These values are compared against the birthday dictionary keys to detect matches.

### String Manipulation and Templating
Personalized birthday messages are generated by:
- Selecting a random template file
- Reading the template text
- Replacing placeholder values such as `[NAME]` with actual contact data

This demonstrates how simple string operations can be used for lightweight templating.

### Randomization
The `random` module is used to select from multiple message templates, ensuring that birthday emails are not identical each time the program runs.

### Email Automation with SMTP
The project uses the `smtplib` library to send emails programmatically. Key concepts include:
- Connecting to an SMTP server
- Securing the connection with TLS
- Authenticating with email credentials
- Formatting email headers and message bodies correctly

### Program Structure and Defensive Coding
The code is structured to:
- Separate data loading, processing, and action steps
- Handle common errors such as invalid data types and header rows
- Make the logic readable and extensible for future features

## Outcome
By completing this project, you gain hands-on experience with automating a real-world task using Python while reinforcing foundational programming concepts such as data parsing, dictionaries, conditionals, functions, and external libraries.
