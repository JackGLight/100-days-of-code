# Day 26 – NATO Phonetic Alphabet

A Python program that converts a user-provided word into its NATO phonetic alphabet representation.

## What I Did
- Loaded NATO phonetic data from a CSV using pandas
- Built a dictionary mapping letters to phonetic code words
- Validated user input to allow only alphabetic characters
- Translated each letter into its corresponding NATO code

## Example
Input:
hello

Output:
['Hotel', 'Echo', 'Lima', 'Lima', 'Oscar']

## Key Takeaways
- Practiced transforming CSV data into dictionaries
- Reinforced input validation techniques
- Used dictionary and list comprehensions for cleaner code
