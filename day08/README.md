Day 8 – Caesar Cipher

A command-line implementation of the Caesar cipher that allows users to encode
or decode messages by shifting letters in the alphabet by a specified amount.

The program preserves non-alphabetic characters, validates user input, and
supports repeated use in a single session.

Concepts practiced:
- string manipulation
- modular arithmetic for wraparound logic
- functions and reusable logic
- input validation with loops and exceptions
- conditional logic
- working with the Python standard library

How it works:
- Users choose whether to encode or decode a message
- A shift value determines how far each letter is moved in the alphabet
- Alphabetic characters are shifted while punctuation and spaces are preserved

Run:
python main.py
